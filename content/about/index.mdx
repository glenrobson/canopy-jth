## Who was John Thomas?

[John Thomas](http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s1-THOM-JOH-1838.html) was a labourer's son from Cellan, Ceredigion. In 
1853 he moved to Liverpool to work in a draper's shop. Over a period of ten years the work had a detrimental 
effect on his health and he was forced to find employment in the open air. Therefore, at the beginning of the 
1860s, he became a traveller for a firm dealing in writing materials and photographs of famous people. At that
time publishing and selling small photographs of celebrities (carte-de-visite photographs) was a very lucrative 
business. When he realised how few of the photographs he had to sell were of Welsh celebrities he undertook to 
change things himself.

He learnt the rudiments of photography and in 1863 he began taking photographs of the famous by inviting a number 
of well-known preachers to sit for their portraits. The enterprise was a success and by 1867 he was confident 
enough to establish his own photographic business, The Cambrian Gallery. He worked as a photographer for about 
forty years, and during that time he travelled widely in north, mid and south Wales taking photographs of 
landscapes as well as people.

## Using John Thomas' photographs in ‘Cymru’

When he retired from business a collection of over three thousand of his negatives was bought by 
[Sir O M Edwards](http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-EDWA-MOR-1858.html) to illustrate the magazine Cymru.
John Thomas had worked with OM for many years by supplying him 
with illustrations and articles for the magazine. OM paid the following tribute to him for help in 
illustrating the magazine, "... you can well understand my joy in receiving an offer of help from 
Mr John Thomas, in his own modest style. I knew that no-one has such a complete collection of views of Welsh 
historic sites. Whenever he visits a particular area, he adds to his collection the picturesque, famous or 
unusual that he finds there. His rich gallery has been made available to me to use with the warmest of 
welcomes... It is good to know that the Cambrian Gallery contains a collection of views from nearly every 
part of Wales, and of the characters who lived in those parts in recent years." (Translated from Welsh, 
_Cymru_ 17 (1899), p.134)

John Thomas died in October 1905.

Today the negatives which O M Edwards bought from John Thomas form part of the photographic collection 
of the National Library of Wales.
